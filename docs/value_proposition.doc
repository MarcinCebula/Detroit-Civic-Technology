- Mobile friendsly - why is this imporant
       Higher Conversion Rates - A higher conversion rate is always the goal. The more sales you make, the more successful your business. With a responsive website, you’re reaching a much larger audience. This means more people will be seeing your site. Additionally, many people now shop on mobile devices. If your site is responsive, it will make it much easier for customers to shop and buy on your site leading to more sales and more success for your business.
       Lower Bounce Rates - A bounce rate is when a visitor comes to your site and leaves immediately. This is bad for website analytics and for the function of your website. If your bounce rate is high then your site might be in need of a redesign.
       The average user won’t wait more than five seconds for a website to load. Websites that are responsive have quicker load times and are all around just easier to use. The more user-friendly the website is, the more the site will be used by its visitors. You want your visitors to stay on your site as long as possible and hopefully end their visit with a conversion. The best way to make this happen is to establish a responsive web design.
